# Machine-Learning-coursework

Grade Achieved: 70

This coursework looks at two datasets, namely the fashion MNIST dataset and the California Housing dataset.

The fashion MNIST dataset is analysed by using the EM algorithm to reason about the difficulty of the task. Then the dataset is processed by applying PCA, standardizing the data, and then using a support vector machine and neural network to perform the task of classification. The decision boundaries are plotted for both models, and a deeper comparison between the two model is also provided.
The California dataset is analysed through Pandas to decide whether it needs to be cleaned and transformed. The dataset is analysed through Bayesian Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, and finally a deeper comparison between the models is provided.
